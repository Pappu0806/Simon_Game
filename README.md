Simon Game is a game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of flashing lights and tones in the correct order.
How to play
The game starts with a steady pace, but the sequences become more complicated as you play.
To start a new game, press any key from your keyboard.
A color will flash, and you press that color to repeat the sequence. 
The game will add another color to the sequence, and you repeat it.
If you get the order wrong, the game will make the background red and display Game Over! with your score.
